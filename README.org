* =rsimapnotify=

Like =goimapnotify=, but in Rust. And with some more capabilities. But otherwise mostly the same[fn:1].

* TBD [0/1]
** TODO Parse =goimapnotify= config
** TODO Implement actions that =goimapnotify= does
** TODO Add our own config options above and beyond
** TODO Parse =mbsync= configuration so there's even fewer config files
** TODO Optimizations

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Mostly a learning exercise for me. If it turns out to be useful to others, that would be delightful!
